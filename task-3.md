## Task 3: How to solve the high volume of write operations in RDS MySQL databases?

It all depends on what you are actually trying to do but you'll need to provide a lot more information in order to get good advice.

What do you mean by large number of writes? 10? 100? 1000? per second?

What is the schema you are trying to write to? What indexes are implemented on the schema?

Do you have heavy reads to writes or is this all writes?

What are you doing during your write? Is it a single row you are writing or is it a number of operations wrapped in a transaction?

What is the server configuration? Memory? Disk? Version of mySQL.

Are you using Innodb for the database?
